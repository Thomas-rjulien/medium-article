      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I thought I was destined to be a night owl forever.
        I’m no stranger to reading about the benefits of waking up early or having the same sleeping routine — all of us have probably read this at some point in our lives. I’m in my final semester of university, so the past few years of my life have been absolute chaos. I have classes some days, work other days, and have free time on especially rare days. Having a routine seemed impossible.
        But a few months ago, I started reading Haruki Murakami’s novels. My favorite is Norwegian Wood. Inspired by Murakami’s fascinating prose, I researched him a little.

      <h2>Mesmerism</h2>
      <p>Mesmerism has been a part of my life since I was a child; it’s the sense I have every time I establish a new habit. I mesmerized myself as a child to brush my teeth every day in the morning. As an adult, I’ve mesmerized myself to be healthy by exercising regularly. I’ve mesmerized myself to reflect on my life by adding a journaling routine.
      A surge of motivation struck me, knowing I had done a similar task in the past. I could become an early bird by mesmerizing myself.
      For the past 3 months, I’ve successfully transitioned into being an early bird. I go to sleep at 9 p.m. on average 6-7 nights a week. I currently wake up between 5–5:30 a.m. naturally.
      I might continue experimenting with waking up even earlier, but I’m happy with my current routine and don’t want to put too much pressure on myself. After all, it’s healthy to get 8 hours of sleep, isn’t it?
      I’ve tried to become an early bird many times in my life and this is the first time it has actually worked. Here’s what this process of “mesmerizing” myself looked like—and also a few words about what doesn’t work.
      What really worked was more gentle than you might expect. Consider this, then, a compassionate guide to waking up early.

      <a href="">The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism.</a>
      <h2>Clarify Your Purpose for Waking Up Early</h2>
      <p>Waking up before everyone else is tough. If you don’t have a reason to do it, you won’t do it.
      I don’t just mean purpose in the sense that you want to wake up to do something. Of course, you’re going to wake up early to do something (probably productive). But you need a purpose that extends past a basic task.
      I’m about to graduate from university and I’m about to enter arguably the most important years of my life — years where I’ll have both money and freedom. If I ever want a chance at escaping at the 9–5, I have to do something now. Working in the morning is easier than working at night, so I need to set up my habits now so I can be living that life later.
      You might already have a purpose, but if you don’t, try running a 5 Whys analysis (otherwise known as root cause analysis).</p>
